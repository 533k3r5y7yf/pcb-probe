Ported to C++ by Ivan Deras on 2013 (ideras@gmail.com)

This program will read in a pcb-gcode (Eagle) or pcb2gcode etch file and 
add gcode to probe the board beforehand, then adjust milling depth to compensate
for board/table height variations.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
IF YOUR PROBE FAILS YOU WILL BREAK BITS
PLEASE ONLY USE ON ETCH FILES (not drill or mill)
